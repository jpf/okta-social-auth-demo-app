## Developer notes

### Key files

-   `social-auth-demo/routes/index.js` and `social-auth-demo/views/index.jade`
    
    These are the files with the code and template responsible for
    rendering the `/` route. The code uses the Okta API to fetch a list
    of available Social Authentication providers, which it passes to
    the template for rendering into buttons. The code is also
    responsible for rendering the `/social_auth_processing` route.
-   `social-auth-demo/routes/admin.js` and
    `social-auth-demo/views/admin.jade`
    
    The files responsible for rendering the `/admin` route.

### Endpoints

-   `/admin`
    
    The Admin panel.
-   `/social_auth_processing`
    
    The route that handles completed Social Authentication flows.
